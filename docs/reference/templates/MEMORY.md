# MEMORY

Long-term, curated memory for durable context.

## Store Here

- Stable user preferences
- Reusable constraints and policies
- Repeated failure patterns and fixes
- Important environment facts

## Do Not Store Here

- Ephemeral step-by-step logs
- Large raw dumps
- Secrets unless explicitly requested

## Maintenance

- Keep entries concise and timestamped when relevant.
- Remove stale or contradicted items.
- Sync with daily memory files when new durable facts appear.
